# Dictionary-Attack-Script
A script written in python to continuously attack an account using pre-generated password list. I only tried it on Instagram to crack my second account's password, but it should work with most websites. 

Download it and add relevant passwords in the pswd.txt file.  
Then run it using some type of python IDE. 
run command `python main.py`
