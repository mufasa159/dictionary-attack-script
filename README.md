# Dictionary Attack Script
A script written in python (for educational purpose) to continuously attack an account using pre-generated password list. I only tried it on Instagram to crack my second account's password, but it should work with most websites. 

Download it and add relevant passwords in the pswd.txt file.  
Then run it using some type of python IDE. 
run command `python main.py` 

I recommend using a VPN or proxy servers when you're attacking an account. Because, most websites block IP addresses when they recieve a huge amount of requests from the same place. Also, if you're hacking someone, first thing you want to keep in mind is being anonymous.
